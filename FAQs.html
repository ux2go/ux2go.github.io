									<h2>What is UX2GO?</h2>
<p>UX2GO is a service that was created with the aim of providing actionable insights to those looking for a cost-effective and time-saving solution to improving the UX of their digital interfaces.</p><br>

<h2>What do we do?</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, UX research has gained more and more recognition as a vital part of the design process. However, we know that it can be hard to find the time and resources to carry it out effectively and <u>impartially</u>.
<br></p><p>With strong roots in psychology and experience leading UX research activities across a wide range of industries (healthcare, finance, education, e-commerce, and telecommunication), UX2GO is primed to undertake research activities that are guaranteed to improve your understanding of intended users and the prospects of your designs.</p><br>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>As UX2GO is an online service, it doesn't matter where you are in the world. <u>UX2GO comes to you</u>. And it's very simple. You can see when UX2GO has available slots on the <a>calendar</a> page and <a>contact us</a> to book a project. Normally, we will then look to set up a call to answer any questions and iron out the details. We then start the project on the agreed upon date, providing updates as necessary. By end-of-play on the last day of the project, you can expect a package containing: 
<ul><ul><ul><ul><li>a full write-up and analysis in the form of a presentation deck</li><li>any raw data collected</li><li>recommendations for next steps.</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></p><br>

<h2>How long is a project?</h2>
<p>How long is a piece of string? No two projects are the same but typically you can expect a standard round of user testing (which includes writing an interview script, recruitment, running 6 remote user interviews, data analysis, and write-up) to take between 5 and 8 working days dependent on user requirements. Other services, such as heuristic reviews, typically require a shorter time to complete (2 to 3 days) as there are no recruitment needs.</p>
